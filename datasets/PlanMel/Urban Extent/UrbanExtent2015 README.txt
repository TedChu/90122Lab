Title: Urban Extent 2015

Description: Polygon layer showing extent of urban area in 2015.

This layer is based upon the previous years urban extent and extends the urban area to include 2015 Urban Development Program data (parcels of broadhectare land shown as developed or under construction and industrial land shown as unavailable or occupied).  This layer has also been manually checked against aerial photography and visually checked for "holes". Small polygons have been joined to the main urban extent polygon where only a road separates them.

This layer is indicative only and designed only for cartographic use.  It should not be used for any detailed analysis work.
