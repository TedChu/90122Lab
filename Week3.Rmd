# ggplot2
From wikipedia and R-project website, 
*``ggplot2 is a data visualization package for the statistical programming language R. Created by Hadley Wickham in 2005, ggplot2 is an implementation of Leland Wilkinson's Gurky Gangâ€”a general scheme for data visualization which breaks up graphs into semantic components such as scales and layers. ggplot2 can serve as a replacement for the base graphics in R and contains a number of defaults for web and print display of common scales. Since 2005, ggplot2 has grown in use to become one of the most popular R packages."*

It is a general framework for data visualisation, and in this class, we will use it to visualise spatial data and spatio-temporal data. 

* Please study Chapter 9 of the book *R for Data Science* (https://r4ds.hadley.nz/).

# Layers
```{r, echo=TRUE, fig.width=6, fig.align="center", message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```


An Example
```{r, echo=TRUE, fig.width=8, fig.align="center", results = 'hold'}
f = lm(hwy~displ, data = mpg)
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))
```


Add one more layer (the line)
```{r, echo=TRUE, fig.width=8, fig.align="center", results = 'hold'}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_abline(slope = f$coef[2], intercept = f$coef[1])
```

# Others

9.3 geom_point, geom_line, color, fill, alpha

9.4 facet\_wrap, facet\_grid
