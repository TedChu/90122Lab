# ggplot2
According to wikipedia and R-project website, 
*``ggplot2 is a data visualization package for the statistical programming language R. Created by Hadley Wickham in 2005, ggplot2 is an implementation of Leland Wilkinson's Gurky Gangâ€”a general scheme for data visualization which breaks up graphs into semantic components such as scales and layers. ggplot2 can serve as a replacement for the base graphics in R and contains a number of defaults for web and print display of common scales. Since 2005, ggplot2 has grown in use to become one of the most popular R packages."*

It is a general framework for data visualisation, and in this class, we will use it to visualise spatial data and spatio-temporal data. 

* Please study Chapter 3 of the book *R for Data Science* (https://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-visualisation.html).
